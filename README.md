# SDI-WORKSHOP-TODO-LIST

![|50](https://www.templateral.com/wp-content/uploads/To-Do-List-Printable-Template-Sample.jpg)
## Requirements

-   In this application you will create a to-do list application that can do the following:
    -   Users should be able to view all of the to-do tasks
    -   Users should be able to add a to-do to the list of to-do tasks
    -   Users should be able to remove to-do's, this could be either deletion or crossing out
    -   The page should be aesthetically pleasing (aka be styled)
## Stretch goals

-   Add some instructions to your `README.md` file around what your application is, how to run it, and how to use it.
-   Make the list persist through a refresh of the page by using local storage to store to-do's
-   Archive completed tasks in a viewable location on screen
